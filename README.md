# Society-App

This app aims to revolutionise the way people in a society communicate with each other, the security and the outside world.

The app is for communication between the residents of a housing complex, security and 3rd party people. This app is necessary because we need to communicate regularly between the residents and the guards for various things like allowing the pizza delivery boy to come to my house with ten boxes of pizza for my local hack club, other times it is for cleaning a park bench which has been littered with Orpheus's poo. I created the app for this purpose only.

I have used Thunkable platform to make this app where I have coded the app (block based), designed the front-end and connected Airtable as a database. I have also added email verification service using Google's Firebase.

Check out this app - https://x.thunkable.com/projectPage/667800454c50947feed07ce8

You can remix this app or look at the block code using the "edit project" option on the top left.
